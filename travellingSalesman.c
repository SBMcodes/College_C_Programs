// What is travelling salesman problem and how to solve it?
// Travelling salesman problem is nothing but finding the minimum cost
// hamiltonian cycle (Path where we visit each node exactly once and it should end where it has started from) 
// in a weighted undirected graph We can solve travelling salesman
// by using dynamic programming approach

// It basically solves the problem of a salesman who is traveling through many cities
// and he needs to find minimum cost path so he can travel through
// all the cities and at the end comes back to his home city
